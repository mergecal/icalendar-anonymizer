# Contributing to icalendar-anonymizer

Thanks for contributing to icalendar-anonymizer.


## Getting Started

Fork and clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mergecal/icalendar-anonymizer.git
cd icalendar-anonymizer
```

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This includes pytest, ruff, pre-commit, and commitizen. For building docs, use `pip install -e ".[doc]"`.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes with tests
3. Run tests and linting locally
4. Commit following conventional commits format
5. Push and open a pull request

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

90% minimum coverage required. PRs fail if coverage drops. All tests must pass before merge.

CI runs tests on Python 3.11-3.13 across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. Coverage is tracked via Codecov.

### Code Quality

Check code style and auto-format:

```bash
ruff check .    # Check for linting errors
ruff format .   # Auto-format code
```

CI enforces the same Ruff version and checks.

## Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). See [docs/contribute/commit-format.rst](docs/contribute/commit-format.rst) for full details.

Format: `type(scope): subject`

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`, `style`, `revert`

**Examples**:
```
feat(cli): add --output flag for file writing
fix(api): prevent SSRF in URL fetching
docs: update installation instructions
```

**PR titles** must follow the same format. We use squash merge, so the PR title becomes the commit message on `main`.

### Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)

Enable to validate commits locally:

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Pre-commit runs:
- Commit message validation (commitizen)
- Ruff linting and formatting
- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file newline check
- YAML/JSON validation
- Large file prevention

Checks run in under 5 seconds. CI validates all commits and PR titles regardless.

## Pull Request Process

- One approval required before merge
- All tests must pass
- Update `CHANGES.rst` with your changes
- Follow conventional commit format for PR title

## Documentation

Update `CHANGES.rst` for user-facing changes. See the file header for formatting guidelines.

Add docstrings to public APIs. We use Sphinx for documentation generation.

**Build system**: Uses hatchling with hatch-vcs for automatic version management.

**Code style**: 100-character line length enforced by Ruff.
